42 of 42 synthetic calls, 12 templates, languages: hinglish, tamil-english, bengali-english, marathi-english. Scored by code against hand-written keys; the model never grades.

| Field | Accuracy |
|---|---|
| Outcome | 100.0% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100.0%) |
| Reason code (all) | 100.0% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100.0%) |
| Reason code, model-refined calls | 100.0% (28/28; 95% CI 87.9-100.0%) |
| Reason code, decided by code | 100.0% (14/14; 95% CI 78.5-100.0%) |
| Moments found (recall) | 97.2% (35/36; 95% CI 85.8-99.5%) |
| Every moment found | 97.6% (41/42; 95% CI 87.7-99.6%) |
| Crisis signal | 100.0% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100.0%) |
| Crisis recall | 100.0% (3/3; 95% CI 43.9-100.0%) |
| Opt-out, analysis | 100.0% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100.0%) |
| Opt-out recall, analysis | 100.0% (5/5; 95% CI 56.6-100.0%) |
| Opt-out recall, deterministic floor | 100.0% (5/5; 95% CI 56.6-100.0%) |
| Follow-ups owed | 100.0% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100.0%) |
| Grounded quotes (kept / proposed) | 100.0% (100/100; 95% CI 96.3-100.0%) |

**Cost:** 39 model calls, 27868 input and 4093 output tokens, 820 tokens per call, about ₹0.047 per call.

## Cross-call slice

16 calls with 3 planted objection themes; 16 sampled; 3 themes returned.

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| Planted themes recalled (2+ quotes, all from that theme's calls) | 100.0% (3/3; 95% CI 43.9-100.0%) |
| Themes whose quotes all come from one planted theme | 100.0% (3/3; 95% CI 43.9-100.0%) |
| Model quotes that were verbatim | 100.0% (8/8; 95% CI 67.6-100.0%) |

Funnel over the seeded slice: dialled 16, connected 16, talked 16, goal reached 4 ({"verified":0,"manager":0,"ai_guess":4}).

## Misses

- `objection_resolved.realestate.hinglish`: outcome agreed (key agreed), reason CONV_GOAL_DONE (key CONV_GOAL_DONE), moments [commitment] (key [objection, commitment])

## Harness ledger (every model request)
