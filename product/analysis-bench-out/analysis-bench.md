42 of 42 synthetic calls, 12 templates, languages: hinglish, tamil-english, bengali-english, marathi-english. Scored by code against hand-written keys; the model never grades.

| Reason code, model-refined calls | 100.0% (29/29; 95% CI 88.3-100.0%) |
| Reason code, decided by code | 100.0% (13/13; 95% CI 77.2-100.0%) |
| Moments found (recall) | 100.0% (36/36; 95% CI 90.4-100.0%) |
| Every moment found | 100.0% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100.0%) |
| Crisis signal | 100.0% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100.0%) |
| Crisis recall | 100.0% (3/3; 95% CI 43.9-100.0%) |
| Opt-out, analysis | 100.0% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100.0%) |
| Opt-out recall, analysis | 100.0% (4/4; 95% CI 51.0-100.0%) |
| Opt-out recall, deterministic floor | 100.0% (4/4; 95% CI 51.0-100.0%) |
| Follow-ups owed | 100.0% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100.0%) |
| Grounded quotes (kept / proposed) | 72.9% (105/144; 95% CI 65.1-79.5%) |

**Cost:** 39 model calls, 25761 input and 4680 output tokens, 781 tokens per call (no price set: VP_BENCH_INR_PER_1K_INPUT/OUTPUT).

## Cross-call slice

20 calls with 3 planted objection themes; 20 sampled; 3 themes returned.

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| Planted themes recalled (2+ quotes, all from that theme's calls) | 100.0% (3/3; 95% CI 43.9-100.0%) |
| Themes whose quotes all come from one planted theme | 100.0% (3/3; 95% CI 43.9-100.0%) |
| Model quotes that were verbatim | 66.7% (6/9; 95% CI 35.4-87.9%) |

Funnel over the seeded slice: dialled 20, connected 20, talked 20, goal reached 5 ({"verified":0,"manager":0,"ai_guess":5}).
